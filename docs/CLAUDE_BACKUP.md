## 🔧 SOLVED ISSUES & DECISIONS

### Issue 1: Yahoo Finance Blocking ✅ SOLVED
**Problem:** Yahoo Finance blocks automated requests, even with custom headers and user agents
**User Feedback:** "Too Many Requests. Rate limited. Try after a while."
**Solution:** Migrated to Polygon.io API
**Decision:** Removed ALL references to yfinance and Alpha Vantage per user request
**Files Changed:**
- Removed `alpha_vantage_fetcher.py`, `ALPHA_VANTAGE_SETUP.md`
- Cleaned `stock_fetcher.py` (Polygon.io only)
- Updated `requirements.txt` (removed yfinance, alpha-vantage)
- Updated `docker-compose.yml` (removed Alpha Vantage env vars)

### Issue 2: API Key Configuration ✅ SOLVED
**Problem:** User edited `.env.example` instead of `.env`
**Explanation:** `.env.example` is a template, Docker reads from `.env`
**Solution:** Created `.env` file with actual API key
**Learning:** Always explain the difference between example and actual config files

### Issue 3: Data Provider Selection ✅ SOLVED
**User Request:** "no please use polygon.io instend i already got account here"
**Decision:** Made Polygon.io the ONLY provider (no fallbacks)
**Files Changed:**
- Created `polygon_fetcher.py` with full Polygon.io integration
- Simplified `stock_fetcher.py` to only use Polygon.io
- Updated all documentation to remove other providers

### Issue 4: Phase 3 Implementation Strategy ✅ SOLVED
**Approach:** Adapted user's existing `oldTools` rather than creating from scratch
**Inspiration:**
- `rsi.py`, `macd.py`, `bollinger.py`, `moving_average.py` → `technical_indicators.py`
- `ai_predictor.py` (LSTM, Transformer, CNN) → For Phase 4
- Signal-based approach with BUY/SELL/HOLD recommendations
**Result:** User-familiar implementation style

---

## ⚠️ KNOWN ISSUES & LIMITATIONS

### Issue 1: Intraday Data Not Available 🔴 UNSOLVED
**Problem:** Polygon.io free tier doesn't support intraday intervals (1m, 5m, 1h)
**Status:** Frontend still shows these options in StockDetail.jsx dropdown
**Impact:** User will get error if they select intraday intervals
**Potential Fix:** Remove or disable intraday options from frontend dropdown
**Priority:** Medium (won't break app, just confusing UX)

### Issue 2: ML Models Not Yet Integrated ✅ SOLVED (Phase 4)
**Problem:** Prediction endpoint uses simple MA slope, not actual ML models
**Solution:** Created ml_predictor.py with full ML implementation
**Files Created:**
- `backend/app/services/ml_predictor.py` - LSTM, Transformer, CNN, CNN-LSTM models
- `backend/app/api/routes/ml.py` - Training and prediction endpoints
- `backend/app/schemas/ml_sentiment.py` - Pydantic schemas
**Status:** ML models fully integrated and operational

### Issue 3: No Prediction Performance Tracking ✅ SOLVED (Phase 4)
**Problem:** Predictions were saved but never evaluated against actual results
**Solution:** Created APScheduler service for automated evaluation
**Files Created:**
- `backend/app/services/scheduler.py` - Daily prediction evaluation job
- Integrated into main.py with lifespan management
**How it works:**
1. Scheduler runs daily at midnight
2. Fetches predictions that have reached target date
3. Compares predicted_price vs actual_price from stock_prices
4. Calculates error, accuracy score
5. Stores in prediction_performance table
**Status:** Automated evaluation system operational

### Issue 4: Frontend Rebuild Needed After Changes 🟡 MINOR
**Problem:** React app needs rebuild after backend schema changes
**Workaround:** `docker-compose restart frontend` usually sufficient
**Status:** Not critical, just FYI

### Issue 5: Null Value Handling in TechnicalAnalysis Component ✅ SOLVED
**Problem:** TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'toFixed')
**User Reported:** Error when clicking "Run Analysis" button
**Root Cause:** Backend returns null for some indicator values (e.g., when MACD signal_line is null but MACD value exists)
**Solution:** Added `safeToFixed()` helper function that checks for null/undefined before calling .toFixed()
**File Changed:** `frontend/src/components/TechnicalAnalysis.jsx`
**Fix Applied:**
```javascript
const safeToFixed = (value, decimals) => {
  return (value !== null && value !== undefined) ? value.toFixed(decimals) : 'N/A';
};
```
**Status:** Fixed, component now gracefully handles all null/undefined values

### Issue 6: Docker Unresponsive During Pattern Implementation 🔴 UNSOLVED
**Problem:** All Docker commands timing out (docker-compose down, docker restart, docker exec)
**When Occurred:** Session 4, after completing candlestick pattern recognition code
**Impact:** Cannot apply database schema changes or test new pattern detection feature
**Root Cause:** Docker Desktop appears hung or containers in bad state
**Workaround:** Manual SQL provided to create candlestick_patterns table
**Solution Required:** User must restart Docker Desktop manually
**Next Steps:**
1. Close Docker Desktop completely
2. Reopen Docker Desktop
3. Run `docker-compose down -v` to remove old containers
4. Run `docker-compose up --build -d` to rebuild with new schema
**Priority:** High (blocks testing of Phase 5)
