## üö´ Rejected Features

### ML-Based Pattern Recognition (Phase 3 Optional)
**Status**: REJECTED
**Reason**: Rule-based system achieving 80-95% accuracy. ML adds complexity without significant benefit. Focus on data collection for CNN training instead.

---

## üîÑ Next Steps

### Week 1-2: CNN Model Training Setup
1. Collect 1,000+ labeled patterns across all stocks
2. Prepare training dataset (images + labels)
3. Set up PyTorch training pipeline
4. Train initial CNN model
5. Evaluate on test set

### Week 3-4: Model Integration & Testing
1. Create prediction API endpoint
2. Integrate CNN predictions with rule-based detection
3. Compare CNN vs rule-based accuracy
4. Fine-tune model based on results

### Week 5-6: Context-Aware Scoring
1. Implement market phase detection
2. Add volatility context adjustments
3. Detect key support/resistance levels
4. Integrate context factors into confidence scores

### Week 7-8: User Features & Polish
1. User authentication system
2. Alert system (email/webhook)
3. Pattern backtesting dashboard
4. Performance optimization
5. Documentation updates

## üìù Notes

### Development Philosophy
- **Quality over quantity**: Fewer, high-confidence patterns > many low-quality signals
- **Incremental development**: Complete one phase before starting next
- **Test-driven**: Write tests for new features
- **Documentation-first**: Update docs with every major change

### Architecture Principles
- **Service layer pattern**: Business logic in services, not controllers
- **Shared utilities**: DRY principle for common calculations
- **Backward compatibility**: Don't break existing features
- **Scalability**: Design for 1,000+ stocks, 100+ users

### Trade-offs & Decisions
- **Top-down multi-timeframe**: Daily patterns primary, 1h/4h for confirmation (industry standard for swing trading)
- **Rule-based over ML**: Simpler, more interpretable, easier to debug
- **PostgreSQL + TimescaleDB**: Time-series optimization without separate database
- **React without state management**: Keep it simple until needed (100+ components)
