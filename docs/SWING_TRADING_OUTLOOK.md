## ⚠️ Limitations for Swing Trading

### 1. **No Real-Time Intraday Data**
**Limitation**: Polygon.io free tier provides daily data only (updated after market close)

**Impact**:
- Can't perform intraday swing entries/exits
- Can't catch breakouts immediately as they happen
- Pattern detection runs on end-of-day data

**Workaround**:
- Fine for end-of-day analysis and next-morning entries
- Set limit orders at breakout prices after market close
- Upgrade to Polygon.io paid tier for real-time data ($99-$299/month)

### 2. **No Automated Alerts**
**Limitation**: No email/SMS/push notifications when patterns form

**Impact**:
- Must manually check for new setups daily
- Could miss opportunities if you don't check regularly
- No "set and forget" monitoring

**Workaround**:
- Create daily routine to run batch detection (5-10 minutes)
- Use external alert services with broker platform
- Consider implementing webhook notifications (future enhancement)

### 3. **No Portfolio Management**
**Limitation**: No position sizing, P&L tracking, or portfolio optimization

**Impact**:
- Need separate tools for money management
- Can't track overall portfolio performance
- No risk management across multiple positions

**Workaround**:
- Use spreadsheet for position sizing (1-2% risk per trade)
- Track trades in broker platform or trading journal software
- Future enhancement: Add portfolio management module

### 4. **No Historical Backtesting**
**Limitation**: Can't test pattern profitability on historical data

**Impact**:
- Unknown win rate and expectancy before live trading
- Can't optimize detection parameters for historical performance
- No strategy validation before risking capital

**Workaround**:
- Manual backtesting by reviewing old confirmed patterns
- Use the pattern confirmation feature to build dataset, then analyze
- Future enhancement: Backtest module using confirmed pattern outcomes

### 5. **Manual Trade Execution**
**Limitation**: No broker integration or automated order placement

**Impact**:
- Must manually place orders based on signals
- Human error in order entry possible
- Can't execute during market hours if unavailable

**Workaround**:
- Use broker's trading platform for execution
- Set GTC (Good-Till-Canceled) limit orders
- See "Automated Trading Platforms" section below for API integration options

## 🎯 Optimal Swing Trading Workflows

### **Daily Evening Routine** (15-20 minutes)

**Step 1: Batch Pattern Detection** (5 min)
```
1. Open Stock Analyzer dashboard
2. Click "🎯 Detect Patterns" (batch mode)
3. Wait for detection to complete (335 stocks × 3 sec = ~17 min)
4. System detects patterns with optimal presets:
   - Overlap threshold: 5%
   - Peak sensitivity: 4
   - Min confidence: 50%
   - Exclude rounding patterns
```

**Step 2: Filter High-Quality Setups** (5 min)
```
1. Filter by confidence > 70%
2. Review validation metrics for each pattern:
   - Flags: Parallelism > 70%, R² > 0.7
   - Triangles: Convergence quality > 70%
   - H&S: Neckline R² > 0.8
3. Shortlist 5-10 best setups
```

**Step 3: Technical Confirmation** (5 min)
```
For each shortlisted pattern:
1. Check RSI: Should be 30-70 range (not overbought/oversold)
2. Check MACD: Should align with pattern signal
3. Check ADX: > 25 indicates strong trend
4. Check overall recommendation: Should match pattern signal
5. View signal radar chart: Look for indicator agreement
```

**Step 4: Trade Planning** (5 min)
```
For each confirmed setup:
1. Entry: Breakout price + $0.10 (for market orders)
2. Stop: Pattern invalidation level
3. Target: Calculated target price
4. Position size: Risk 1-2% of account per trade
5. Set alerts on broker platform or place GTC limit orders
```

### **Morning Pre-Market Routine** (5 minutes)
```
1. Check if any limit orders were triggered overnight
2. Review pre-market price action on watchlist stocks
3. Adjust orders if needed based on gaps or news
4. Confirm risk management still appropriate
```

### **Trade Management**
```
1. Place entry order at breakout price
2. Simultaneously place stop loss order
3. Set alert at target price (or use limit order)
4. Monitor daily for:
   - Stop hit (exit)
   - Target hit (exit)
   - Pattern invalidation (exit)
   - Trailing stop adjustment (optional for runners)
```

## 📈 Pattern-Specific Strategies

### **Trending Markets** (Use Continuation Patterns)

**Flag Patterns:**
```
✓ Best for: Strong trending stocks with brief consolidation
✓ Entry: Breakout above flag resistance (bullish) or below support (bearish)
✓ Target: Flagpole height projected from breakout
✓ Stop: Below flag support (bullish) or above resistance (bearish)
✓ Validation: Parallelism > 70%, steep prior trend
✓ Example: Stock up 15% in 5 days, consolidates 3 days, breaks out
```

**Pennants:**
```
✓ Best for: Quick consolidation after sharp moves
✓ Entry: Breakout from converging trendlines
✓ Target: Pennant pole height projected
✓ Stop: Opposite side of pennant
✓ Validation: Clear convergence, forms in 1-3 weeks
✓ Example: Stock gaps up 8%, forms tight pennant, continues
```

**Triangles (Ascending/Descending):**
```
✓ Best for: Continuation plays with clear bias
✓ Entry: Breakout above resistance (ascending) or below support (descending)
✓ Target: Triangle height at widest point projected
✓ Stop: Opposite trendline
✓ Validation: Multiple touch points, convergence quality > 70%
```

### **Reversal Markets** (Use Reversal Patterns)

**Head and Shoulders:**
```
✓ Best for: Topping patterns after uptrends
✓ Entry: Break below neckline
✓ Target: Head-to-neckline distance projected downward
✓ Stop: Above right shoulder or neckline
✓ Validation: Clear 3-peak structure, neckline R² > 0.8
✓ Confirmation: Volume increase on neckline break
```

**Double Top/Bottom:**
```
✓ Best for: Failed retest of highs/lows
✓ Entry: Break below support (top) or above resistance (bottom)
✓ Target: Distance between peaks/troughs and support/resistance
✓ Stop: Above second peak (top) or below second trough (bottom)
✓ Validation: Peaks/troughs within 3% of each other
```

### **Breakout Trading** (Use Consolidation Patterns)

**Cup and Handle:**
```
✓ Best for: Long-term bullish continuation after correction
✓ Entry: Breakout above handle resistance
✓ Target: Cup depth projected upward
✓ Stop: Below handle low
✓ Validation: Rounded cup base, handle forms in upper half
✓ Timeframe: Usually several weeks to months
```

## 💡 Risk Management Framework

### **Position Sizing**
```
Account Size: $50,000
Risk Per Trade: 1% = $500
Entry: $100
Stop: $98 (2% below entry)
Risk Per Share: $2

Position Size = $500 / $2 = 250 shares

Trade Value: 250 × $100 = $25,000 (50% of account)
```

**Rule of Thumb:**
- Risk 1-2% of account per trade
- Never more than 5 trades open simultaneously
- Never more than 10% total account in one sector

### **Stop Loss Placement**
```
Pattern-Based Stops:
- Flags: Below flag support + 1 ATR
- Triangles: Below triangle support + 1 ATR
- H&S: Above right shoulder + 1 ATR
- Double Bottom: Below both troughs + 1 ATR

Time-Based Stops:
- If pattern doesn't play out in expected timeframe (5-10 days), exit
- If new opposing pattern forms, exit

Profit-Based Stops:
- Once target 50% achieved, move stop to breakeven
- Once target 75% achieved, trail stop to lock in profit
```
