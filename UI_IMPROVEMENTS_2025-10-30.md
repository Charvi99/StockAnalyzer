## Summary of Changes

Addressed all four user-requested improvements to the Risk Tools and Overview sections:

1. ‚úÖ Resized Market Regime section to fit properly in given space
2. ‚úÖ Added explanatory info to Trailing Stop Calculator
3. ‚úÖ Added explanatory info and labels to Portfolio Heat Monitor
4. ‚úÖ Updated Overview "Analysis Summary" to reflect new features

---

## 1. Market Regime Section - Resized ‚úÖ

### Problem
Market Regime component was too large and didn't fit properly in the available space.

### Solution
Reduced all padding, margins, and font sizes to create a more compact layout:

**Changes Made**:
- Padding: 20px ‚Üí 16px
- Title font: 18px ‚Üí 16px
- Subtitle font: 13px ‚Üí 12px
- Card padding: 16px ‚Üí 12px
- Card font sizes reduced by 10-15%
- Margins reduced: 20px ‚Üí 12px
- Removed info box (was taking too much space)

**Result**: Component is now ~30% more compact while maintaining readability.

---

## 2. Trailing Stop Calculator - Added Explanatory Info ‚úÖ

### Problem
Users didn't understand the purpose of the Trailing Stop Calculator or what it tells them.

### Solution
Added a prominent info box at the top explaining:
- What trailing stops do (follow price up, never down)
- Purpose (lock in profits while giving room to breathe)
- How to use it (enter position details)
- Example use case

**New Info Box**:
```
‚ÑπÔ∏è What does this do?

Trailing stops follow price upward but never move down. This locks in profits
as your trade moves in your favor, while giving the stock room to breathe.
Enter your position details to see where your stop should be.

Example: You bought at $100, price is now $110. The trailing stop might be at
$107 - giving you $7/share profit protection while allowing normal volatility.
```

**Styling**: Blue background (#eff6ff) with information icon, highly visible.

## 3. Portfolio Heat Monitor - Comprehensive Improvements ‚úÖ

### Problem A: Unclear Purpose
Users didn't know this tracks ALL positions (not just current stock), or how it works.

### Solution A: Added Explanatory Info Box

**New Info Box**:
```
‚ÑπÔ∏è What does this do?

Prevents over-leveraging by tracking total risk across your entire portfolio.
Add all your open positions (from any stocks) to see if you're risking too much.
Professional traders keep total risk under 6% of capital.

Example: With $10,000 capital and 6% max heat, you can risk up to $600 total.
If you have 3 positions risking $150 each ($450 total), you still have $150
capacity for new trades.
```

### Problem B: No Labels on Position Inputs
Users couldn't tell what each input field meant.

### Solution B: Added Column Headers

**New Header Row**:
```
#  | Symbol  | Entry $  | Stop $  | Shares  |
---+----------+----------+---------+----------+----
1  | [AAPL ]  | [150.00] | [145.00]| [10]     | √ó
```

**Benefits**:
- Clear labels for each column
- Professional table-like appearance
- Users immediately understand what to enter
- Headers styled with gray background (#e5e7eb)

### Problem C: Unclear Placeholders
Old placeholders like "Entry", "Stop Loss", "Size" were vague.

### Solution C: Improved Placeholders & Tooltips

**Updated Inputs**:
- Symbol: placeholder="AAPL", title="Stock symbol (e.g., AAPL, TSLA)"
- Entry: placeholder="150.00", title="Your entry price"
- Stop: placeholder="145.00", title="Your stop-loss price"
- Size: placeholder="10", title="Number of shares"

### Problem D: Global vs Stock-Specific
User noticed this should be global, not stock-specific.

### Solution D: Updated Subtitle
Changed subtitle from:
- "Track total risk across all your open positions"

To:
- "Track total risk across ALL your open positions (not just this stock)"

**Note**: Component remains in Risk Tools tab for now (easy access), but clearly communicates it's for entire portfolio. Moving to a global location is optional future enhancement.

## 4. Overview Analysis Summary - Updated ‚úÖ

### Problem

#### New Card 1: Market Regime

**Styling**:

## Optional Future Enhancement

### Move Portfolio Heat to Global Location

**Current**: In Risk Tools tab (stock-specific view)
**Future Option**: Add to main dashboard or create global "Portfolio" tab

**Why Not Done Now**:
1. User marked as lower priority ("optional")
2. Current location still functional
3. Clarified with subtitle that it's global
4. Would require more significant UI restructuring

**If Needed Later**:
- Create new "Portfolio" top-level tab/page
- Move Portfolio Heat Monitor there
- Add links from Risk Tools to Portfolio tab
- Estimated effort: 2-3 hours

---

- ‚úÖ CSS properly scoped with unique class names
- ‚úÖ Consistent naming conventions
- ‚úÖ Well-commented code
- ‚úÖ Reusable patterns

### Performance:
- ‚úÖ No performance impact (pure CSS/HTML changes)
- ‚úÖ No additional API calls
- ‚úÖ Minimal JavaScript additions

### Accessibility:
