2. Pattern Detection Refinement ðŸŽ¯

  Now that we can see patterns in their "whole form", we can:
  - Fine-tune detection parameters (min pattern length, tolerance thresholds)
  - Add volume confirmation to patterns
  - Implement pattern quality scoring based on:
    - How well points align with trendlines
    - Pattern symmetry
    - Volume profile during pattern formation

  3. Expand Pattern Library ðŸ“Š

  Add more pattern types that traders use:
  - Channels (ascending, descending, horizontal)
  - Rectangle/Consolidation patterns
  - Diamond patterns
  - Triple Tops/Bottoms
  - Rounding Tops/Bottoms
  - Broadening formations

  4. Pattern Backtesting System ðŸ“ˆ

  Track pattern success rates:
  - Record pattern outcomes (did it break out as predicted?)
  - Calculate win rates for each pattern type
  - Risk/reward ratios
  - Best-performing patterns for each stock

  5. Alert System ðŸ””

  - Notify when new patterns are detected
  - Alert on pattern breakouts
  - Email/webhook notifications
  - Pattern screener across multiple stocks

  6. ML-Based Pattern Recognition ðŸ¤–

  - Train a CNN to recognize patterns from chart images
  - Automated pattern validation
  - Pattern similarity search
  - Predict pattern success probability
